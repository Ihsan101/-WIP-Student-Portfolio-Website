⚠️WIP-Student-Portfolio-Website
This project is still a work in progress, it is nowhere near done, and I decided to put it on hold until I learn a bit more about CSS, Javascript and HTML. I am not a frontend developer, this project was created mainly using youtube tutorials and trial and error. It isn't a good project and I do not recommend anyone fork it to try to use parts of it on their own project.
